## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS


### What I learned

This is my first SASS project, so i did not explore all the power it has but i am sure it is a great way 
to write the style file and it will help me get a cleaner and more organized stylesheet.


### Continued development

I want to get more understanding on how to properly work with images in web development.

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - Official SASS Documentation helped me to understand the syntax and basic approach of scss files.
